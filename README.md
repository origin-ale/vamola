# VaMoLA: Variational Montecarlo for Light Atoms
Project for the 2025/26 Computational Materials Physics course at the University of Bologna.

Based on Thijssen §12.2, this project will use Variational Monte Carlo methods to find the ground state of:
- the 1D harmonic oscillator
- the hydrogen atom
- the helium atom
