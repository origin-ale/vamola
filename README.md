# VaMoLA: Variational Montecarlo for Light Atoms
Small project for the 2025/26 Computational Materials Physics course at the University of Bologna.

Based on Thijssen §12.2, this project uses Variational Monte Carlo methods to find the ground state energy of:
- the 1D harmonic oscillator
- the hydrogen atom
- the helium atom
